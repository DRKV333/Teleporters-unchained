# Teleporters unchained
Teleporters unchained is a small mod for Terraria v1.3.5.2 and TModLoader v0.10.1.

# Usage
Are you tired of running kilometers of wiring, just to hook up two teleporters? Do you find teleporter hubs complicated and messy? We've got a solution:

 \* **Wireless teleporters** \*

Wireless teleporters are crafted from a regular teleporter, 10 wires and 8 ectoplasm. They work similarly to regular teleporters, but you don't have to connect them directly with wires. You can change the address of a teleporter by placing gems in its slots. Use the Fine-tuning wrench, which is sold by the Steampunker, to lock the teleporter, and connect it to teleporters with the same address. The teleporters are connected on a cycle. When you activate a teleporter via wire, it sends things to the next pad, and receives things from the previous. Right click on a teleporter with the wrench, to change its position in the cycle.
