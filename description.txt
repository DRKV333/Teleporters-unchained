Are you tired of running kilometers of wiring, just to hook up two teleporters? Do you find teleporter hubs complicated and messy? We've got a solution:

* Wireless teleporters *

Wireless teleporters are sold by the Steampunker after beating Planterra. They work similarly to regular teleporters, but you don't have to connect them directly with wires. You can change the address of a teleporter by placing gems in its slots. Use the Fine-tuning wrench to lock the teleporter, and connect it to teleporters with the same address. The teleporters are connected on a cycle. When you activate a teleporter via wire, it sends things to the next pad, and receives things from the previous. Right click on a teleporter with the wrench, to change its position in the cycle.
